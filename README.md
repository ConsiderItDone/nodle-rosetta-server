## Manual Testing (Transaction broadcasting)
To broadcast a transaction, make POST requests to following endpoints:
1. construction/metadata - to get user's relevant metadata
2. construction/payloads - make a pyalod with retrieved metadata
3. construction/combine - insert from 'construction/payloads' response:
  * unsigned_transaction
  * "hex_bytes" from "payloads[0]" - this bytes goes to signatures[0].signing_payload.hex_bytes
  * make a signature for this bytes (0x`${bytes}`) (here for example: https://nodleprotocol.io/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2F3.217.156.114#/signing )
  * resulting signature pass to signatures[0].hex_bytes (without 0Ñ…)
  * execute 'construction/combine'
4. construction/submit - submit signed transaction from 'construction/combine'
